Shared Dependencies:

1. **Python Libraries**: All Python files will share common Python libraries such as Flask or Django for web framework, SQLite or PostgreSQL for database management, and NLP libraries for understanding user commands.

2. **User Account Information**: The `authentication.py` and `encryption.py` files will share user account information for authentication and encryption purposes.

3. **Code Snippets**: The `code_generator.py`, `code_executor.py`, and `database_manager.py` files will share code snippets generated by the user.

4. **DOM Element IDs**: The JavaScript files (`main.js`, `chat_interface.js`, `theme.js`, `responsive.js`) will share DOM element IDs for manipulating the user interface. These might include IDs for the chat input field, code output area, theme selection dropdown, etc.

5. **CSS Classes and IDs**: The `styles.css` file and the JavaScript files will share CSS classes and IDs for styling and manipulating the user interface.

6. **User Commands**: The `nlp.py` and `code_generator.py` files will share user commands for generating code snippets.

7. **Database Schemas**: The `database_manager.py` file will share database schemas with other backend files for storing and retrieving data.

8. **Message Names**: The `app.py` and `chat_interface.js` files will share message names for communication between the backend and frontend.

9. **Function Names**: All files will share function names for calling functions across different files. For example, a function to generate code might be called `generate_code()` in `code_generator.py` and used in `app.py`.

10. **Learning Resources**: The `tutorials.py`, `examples.py`, and `documentation.py` files will share learning resources for helping users improve their coding skills.
